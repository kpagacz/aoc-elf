/// This CLI is a tool to help you with your Advent of Code challenges.

/// Token management
/// You need an Advent of Code session token to interact with its API. `elv`
/// does not support authentication to the API on its own, so you need to
/// get your token beforehand, and pass it to `elv`. There are a number of ways
/// of setting the token. See `elv config set --help` if you want to set it
/// once and not be bothered by passing it to the `--token` parameter every
/// time you use the CLI.

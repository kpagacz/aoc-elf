* the wait time is global (but this is not such a big deal... because I still cache the too soon responses, so only one additional call per a riddle)
* github ci/cd
* improve the compartmentalization of responsibilities between the main, driver and the aoc api (the driver should return Result<> and everything should be silent until the main)
only main prints anything as the interface, the rest just passes values
* clear input cache
* clear submission cache
* add an option to write input to file, make outputting to std out optional
